At Finn, we use Eik for streamlining and optimising the serving of client side
assets such as CSS and JavaScript. When working with Fabric, we create a CSS
file, import the Fabric core library and publish to Eik for production.

### Import Fabric

First, install the Fabric dependency using NPM

```sh
npm install -D @fabric-ds/css
```

Then create a CSS file for your app. We'll use `styles.css` in these examples.
In this file, import the Fabric core library.

```css
@import url('@fabric-ds/css');
```

If you need custom CSS style rules in your app you can also put them in this
file though most of the time with Fabric you won't need to since you can find
Fabric utility classes for most things you'll need.

### Setup PostCSS build

[PostCSS](https://postcss.org) is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript.
It can be used to create a production ready Fabric CSS file for our app. We use
it with the [Eik PostCSS plugin](https://github.com/eik-lib/postcss-plugin) to
ensure teams at Finn are using the same version.

To start with, install PostCSS and the Eik plugin:

```sh
npm i -D postcss postcss-cli postcss-import @eik/postcss-plugin
```

Afterwards, create a PostCSS config file called `postcss.config.cjs` and give it
the following contents:

```js
module.exports = () => ({
  plugins: [require('@eik/postcss-plugin')(), require('postcss-import')()],
});
```

Now that we have things configured, we can produce a production ready file with
the following command:

```sh
npx postcss ./styles.css -o ./dist/styles.css
```

Note that we create this file in the `dist` folder. Normally, you won't want to
commit this folder to source control so remember to add and entry for it in
`.gitignore`

For convenience, you can add an npm run script in your app's `package.json`
file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build:css": "npx postcss ./styles.css -o ./dist/styles.css"
  }
}
```

which can be run with:

```sh
npm run build:css
```

If you open up `./dist/styles.css`, you should see a file loaded up with CSS
style rules. This is because all of the CSS in the `@fabric-ds/css` NPM package
has been inlined into this file. In the next step we'll use Eik to replace all
this CSS with something production ready.

### Setup Eik

Now that we are producing a production ready CSS file into a `./dist` folder, we
need to setup Eik so that we can publish this folder and make it available on
the Eik CDN.

To learn more about Eik and how it works, please refer to the following links:

- https://eik.dev/docs/overview
- https://eik.dev/docs/overview_concepts
- https://eik.dev/docs/overview_workflow

Create an [eik.json](https://eik.dev/docs/overview_eik_json) file in the app
root folder. This file is used to define meta information about the app's client
side assets and will be used by Eik to determine where to publish to.

```json
{
  "name": "<your app name>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "server": "https://assets.finn.no",
  "type": "package",
  "files": "./dist",
  "import-map": ["https://assets.finn.no/map/fabric/v1"]
}
```

The `files` field tells Eik which local files/folders to include when
publishing, the `import-map` field is used during the PostCSS build for
optimisation purposes. The other fields are used when determining the URL path
to the published files on the Eik server.

### Production ready files with Eik plugins

The file located at `https://assets.finn.no/map/fabric/v1` is an import map. If
you visit the link in a browser, you'll see that `@fabric-ds/css` is mapped to
`https://assets.finn.no/pkg/@fabric-ds/css/v0/fabric.min.css`. Now that we've
setup Eik and added this import map in `eik.json`, when we run our build
command, PostCSS, instead of inlining the Fabric CSS code, is going to replace
references to `@fabric-ds/css` in import statements with value found in the
import map instead. It's this mechanism that we use to line everyone up on the
same version of Fabric across all of Finn. With everyone on the same version, we
get great benefits as users will not need to re-download the Fabric CSS code as
they navigate across the Finn website.

Run the build command one more time:

```sh
npm run build:css
```

And check `./dist/styles.css` and make sure that it contains a single line:

```css
@import 'https://assets.finn.no/pkg/@fabric-ds/css/v0/fabric.min.css';
```

### Publishing to the Eik server

With a build and Eik setup in place, we need to
[authenticate with the Eik server](https://eik.dev/docs/client_login) and then
we should be ready to publish.

```sh
npx @eik/cli login
```

**N.B.** You will be asked for a **key** when running this command. Ask about
this in the **#finn-eik** slack channel.

Once authenticated, run publish

```sh
npx @eik/cli publish
```

You'll find your published file on the CDN at:

```
https://assets.finn.no/pkg/<your app name>/1.0.0/styles.css
```

The Eik server provides metadata about your published assets so you can always
check which version are available by visiting:

```
https://assets.finn.no/pkg/<your app name>
```

And you can find out what files are contained in a specific version with:

```
https://assets.finn.no/pkg/<your app name>/1.0.0
```

### Automate publishing from the CI

In most cases, it is preferrable to have publishing performed as part of your
app's CI build pipeline. You can find a guide for setting this up here:
