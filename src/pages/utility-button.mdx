# Utility buttons

A utility button is a low priority action button that is used to highlight
useful functions. It is utilitarian, in that it’s designed to be useful or
practical rather than attractive, not vying for attention like call-to-action
buttons and taking its place further down in the visual hierarchy.

A utility button is often used when there are multiple similar actions on a page
or when there are tools or components that require additional function.

## Options

<Guideline title="Orientation" image="button-utility-options-orientation.svg">
  An action group can be either horizontal or vertical in its orientation. By
  default, an action group is horizontal. The vertical, or stacked, option
  should be reserved for when horizontal space is limited.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Density" image="button-utility-options-density.svg">
  Action groups come in 2 densities: regular and compact. The compact density
  retains the same font and icon sizes, but has tighter spacing. The action
  buttons also become connected for non-flat action groups.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Justified" image="button-utility-options-justified.svg">
  An action group can become justified. By default, it is not justified since
  the action button size depends on the label and/or icon inside each button.
  When an action group is justified, it takes up the entire available container
  width, divided equally for each action button that is inside the group.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Flat" image="button-utility-options-flat.svg">
By default, an action group uses not-flat action buttons. This style works best in a dense array of controls where the background helps to separate action buttons from the surrounding container, or to give visibility to isolated buttons.

Alternatively, flat action groups can have no visible background until they’re
interacted with. This style works best when a clear layout (vertical stack,
table, grid) makes it easy to parse the buttons. Too many quiet components in a
small space can be hard to read.

</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Enable selection" image="button-utility-options-enable-selection.svg">
By default, selection is not enabled in an action group. This is used for action groups that offer direct actions, rather than toggling.

Selection can be enabled for an action group to allow for toggling. This can be
used to disclose parts of an interface (e.g., showing or hiding panels) or to
switch between views (e.g., grid or list views).

</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Selection mode"
  image="button-utility-options-selection-mode.svg"
>
  When selection is enabled, an action group can allow for single or multiple
  selection of action buttons.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Emphasis" image="button-utility-options-emphasis.svg">
Like action buttons, action groups are not emphasized by default. This is optimal for when the action group is not the core part of an interface, such as in application panels, where all components are monochrome in order to direct focus to the content.

The emphasized action group has a blue background for its selected state in
order to provide a visual prominence that meets the accessible color contrast
ratio. This is optimal for when the selection should call attention, such as
within a tool bar.

</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Empty selection"
  image="button-utility-options-empty-selection.svg"
>
  When selection is enabled, an action group's selection behavior can be set to
  allow for an empty selection, or not.
</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Overflow menu"
  image="button-utility-options-overflow-menu.svg"
>
  When space is limited in an action group, there are 2 options for the group's
  overflow behavior: wrap or collapse. By default, an action group is set to
  wrap, meaning that the action buttons inside the group wrap to form another
  line. Alternatively, an action group can be set to collapse inside an overflow
  (...) action button.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Disabled" image="button-utility-options-disabled.svg">
  A action group in a disabled state shows that the action buttons within the
  group exist, but are not available in that circumstance. This state can be
  used to maintain layout continuity and to communicate that an action group may
  become available later.
</Guideline>
