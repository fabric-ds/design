# Search

A search field is used to quickly find the content you are looking for. Providing the user with suggestions based on recent searches and autocomplete will improve their user experience.  
  
A search field does not need a label, but should contain a text hint/placeholder text and a search-icon at the right end of the input field.  
      

## Auto complete text fields

These text fields are often used in search fields to present suggestions in real time or auto completion of words in a dropdown. This is for users to enter information/search more accurately and efficiently. It is especially useful for those with writing difficulties, when using a language you are not 100% comfortable with or you are unsure of the spelling.


## Best practice


### Do  

-   Use placeholder text to describe what the user can search for, for example "Search for car or cats" or "Search in your ads"  
    
-   Use auto complete suggestions to help the user to search faster  
    
-   Separate different categories in the auto complete suggestions


### Don't  

-   Do not show too many auto complete results, it will seem overwhelming to the user  
    
-   Do not let the search field be empty (before the user has typed anything)  
    
-   Do not use long or vague placeholder texts, the placeholder text is supposed to make it easier for the user
