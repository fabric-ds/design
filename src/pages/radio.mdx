# Radio

Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a list of mutually
exclusive options. All possible options are exposed up front for users to
compare.

### Best practice

- Place radio buttons below each other to ensure that they are easier to find,
  read and work responsively.
- Separate radio buttons and checkboxes with labels.
- Consider dropdowns for more than 6 options.
