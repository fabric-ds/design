# Setup Eik node client

When working with Eik, you'll want to include the Eik client to support local
development. This module switches asset locations between a local app path for
development and an Eik server absolute URL for production. It uses values in
your apps `eik.json` file to determine the location of your assets on the Eik
server.

## Setting it up

First, ensure The Eik Node client is installed as a project dependency

```sh
npm install @eik/node-client@next
```

Next import the client in your app

```js
import Eik from '@eik/node-client';
```

Once imported, instantiate the client, passing it configuration options:

- `base` a base path for where you are serving your apps CSS files for local
  development
- `development` a flag to tell it whether your app is running in local
  development mode or production

```js
const eik = new Eik({
  base: '/public'
  development: true,
});
```

After instantiation, call the `.load()` method. This will cause the client to
read the app's `eik.json` file and use the values found within to construct
URLs/paths to your app's CSS.

```js
await eik.load();
```

Once that's done, the `.file()` method can be called to get back a URL or an app
route to your CSS file for use in your app.

```js
const href = eik.file('styles.css');
// when development is set to true
// href will be /public/styles.css

// when development is set to false
// href will be https://assets.finn.no/pkg/<eik.json name field>/<eik.json version field>/styles.css
```

You can now use the value in `href` in an HTML link tag:

```js
`<link href="${href}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`;
```

Or pass it to Podium podlet or layout to load for you:

```js
podlet.css({ value: href });
// or
layout.css({ value: href });
```
