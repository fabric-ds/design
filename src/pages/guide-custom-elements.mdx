# Setup Fabric Custom elements

If you use don't use React or Vue in your app, you can still get the benefits of
Fabric components and get out of the box functionality with baked in best
practices via custom elements. With Eik in place, getting setup to use custom
elements is straight forward.

## Setting it up

First, install the Fabric Elements package from NPM

```sh
npm install @fabric-ds/elements
```

Next import the Fabric Elements package into your app. You do not need specify
which component(s) you need to use as part of the import. Refer to the Fabric
Elements docs to learn more about the various components and how to use them.

**Please note:** For the time being, the elements package contains only a
limited set of components with more to come in the near future.

```js
import from '@fabric-ds/elements';
```

Components can then be used like any other React components in your code

```jsx
<f-breadcrumbs>
  <a href="#/url/1">Eiendom</a>
  <a href="#/url/2">Bolig til salgs</a>
  <a href="#/url/3" aria-current="page">
    {' '}
    Oslo{' '}
  </a>
</f-breadcrumbs>
```
