## Options

<Guideline title="Label" image="button-options-label.svg">
  All buttons require a label for accessibility.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Primary CTA" image="button-options-primary-cta.svg">
  The primary call to action button communicates strong emphasis and is reserved
  for actions that are essential to an experience. There should only be one
  visible call to action button per page. There is no flat style for this button
  because it is meant to be the most prominent element on the page.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Secondary" image="button-options-secondary.svg">
  The secondary button is for low emphasis. It is meant to be paired with other
  button types to surface less prominent actions. On pages where there are more
  than one important action, multiple secondary buttons can be used. If two
  buttons are equally weighted, both should be secondary buttons (or flat
  buttons).
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Flat" image="button-options-flat.svg">
  By default, buttons have a visible stroke and fill. Flat buttons do not have
  this visible stroke or fill and should only be used for secondary actions
  within a button group. Flat buttons have the same padding rules as other
  action buttons and reveal a button-like background color when hovered.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Destructive Variant" image="button-options-destructive.svg">
  The destructive button is for emphasizing actions that can be destructive or
  have negative consequences if taken. It replaces the primary CTA button in
  these destructive situations and should be used sparingly. A destructive
  button and a primary CTA should never appear on the same screen. The
  destructive button can also exist as a flat button variant in cases where the
  consequence of the action is still destructive, but less critical.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Icon" image="button-options-icon.svg">
  Icons can be used in buttons when additional clarity is required. Icons should
  not be used for decoration. Only 16x16px sized icons should be used in
  buttons.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Size" image="button-options-size.svg">
  Buttons come in two different sizes: defaault, and small. The default size is
  the most frequently used option, with the small variant being used when space
  is limited, or in cases where there are multiple buttons on a page and the
  default size becomes too overwhelming. When using buttons it's important to
  ensure you maintain a good visual hierachy on the page.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Disabled" image="button-options-disabled.svg">
  As a rule, we try to avoid using disabled buttons, instead we try to
  communicate what is or isn't possible by other means, to avoid confusion when
  a user tries to interact with it. A button in a disabled state shows that an
  action exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This state can be
  used to maintain layout continuity and to communicate that an action may
  become available later. Use only as a last resort!
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Loading" image="button-options-loading.svg">
  To show the user that the action they triggered has begun, buttons have an in
  progress or loading state.
</Guideline>

## Behaviors

<Guideline title="Keyboard focus" image="button-behaviors-keyboard-focus.svg">
  A button can be navigated using a keyboard. The keyboard focus state takes the
  button’s visual hover state and adds a blue outer-stroke to the button in
  focus.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Flexible width" image="button-behaviors-flexible-width.svg">
  The width of a button automatically adjusts to fit the text. The default
  padding on each side of the button is set to 16px, with the only exception to
  the rule being when buttons are used as full-width on mobile or in other
  containers when a full-width button makes sense.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Text overflow" image="button-behaviors-text-overflow.svg">
  When the button text is too long for the horizontal space available, it wraps
  to form another line. Best practice is to avoid text wrapping in buttons where
  possible, so if your text wraps over two lines, consider making your text it
  shorter and more concise.
</Guideline>

## Usage guidelines

<Guideline title="Be concise" image="button-usage-guidelines-1-do.svg" good>
  Button text should be concise: 1 or 2 words, no longer than 4 words, with
  fewer than 20 characters including spaces. Don’t use punctuation marks such as
  periods or exclamation points, or other visual elemnts like emojis.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Use clear text" image="button-usage-guidelines-2-do.svg" good>
  Button texts should be clear about the outcome of the action. Most buttons
  should start with a verb. For example, use “Agree” instead of “Yes” in a
  dialog or use “Sign Up” instead of “Submit” in a form.
</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Use sentence case"
  image="button-usage-guidelines-3-do.svg"
  good
>
  Button text should always be in sentence case. Capitalization should never be
  used to give more prominence to a specific button.
</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Don't override color"
  image="button-usage-guidelines-4-do.svg"
  good
>
  Do not use custom colors for buttons. The colors of different button
  variations have been designed to be consistent and accessible across all
  design solutions.
</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Use icons only when neccessary"
  image="button-usage-guidelines-5-do.svg"
  good
>
  Icons can be used in buttons when additional clarity is required and the icon
  is highly relevant to the action. Icons should not be used for decoration.
