# Input

Input, which are often referred to as Text fields, are text boxes that allow
users to input custom text entries with a keyboard. Various options can be shown
with the field to communicate the input requirements.

## Options

<Guideline title="Label" image="input-options-label.svg">
  Inputs should always have a label. The only exceptions to this rule are search
  fields, and message input fields which can be more easily understood in their
  layout context. For numerical inputs, always include the unit type in the
  label to clarify what type of input information is needed, e.g. (cm, kg)
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Label position" image="input-options-label-position.svg">
  Labels should be placed on top of the input. Top labels are recommended
  because they help anchor form components to a left margin, making it easier to
  scan a form. They also allow room for more descriptive text, and responsive
  layouts.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Placeholder" image="input-options-placeholder.svg">
  The placeholder text, also commonly known as “ghost text,” is temporary and
  disappears once a user enters text. This should only be used to give the user
  a hint of what kind of information, and in what format they should enter their
  text. Including instructions, requirements, or other detailed information into
  placeholder text is not accessible (as it disappears as soon as the user type
  ssomething else) and hence not recommended. Help text is the preferred way to
  communicate this information. Never use placeholder text instead of a label.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Value" image="input-options-value.svg">
  The value shows a user’s entered text.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Width" image="input-options-width.svg">
  The width of an input can be customized appropriately for its context. For
  example, when asking for a telephone number, the input field should be wide
  enough to accomodate the maximum number of digits, but no wider.
</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Required or optional"
  image="input-options-required-or-optional.svg"
>
  inputs can be marked as optional when user input is not required. Optional
  inputs are denoted with text added to the end of the label — “(optional)”.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Error" image="input-options-error.svg">
  An input can be marked as having an error to show that a value needs to be
  entered in order to move forward or that a value that was entered is invalid.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Disabled" image="input-options-disabled.svg">
  An input in a disabled state shows that an input field exists, but is not
  available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity
  and communicate that a field may become available later.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Read-only" image="input-options-read-only.svg">
  Inputs have a read-only option for when content in the disabled state still
  needs to be shown. This allows for content to be copied, but not interacted
  with or changed. An input does not have a read-only option if there is nothing
  entered in it.
</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Help text (description and error message)"
  image="input-options-help-text.svg"
>
  An input can have help text below the field to give extra context or
  instruction about what a user should input in the field. The help text area
  has two options: a description and an error message. The description
  communicates a hint or helpful information, such as specific requirements for
  correctly filling out the field. The error message communicates an error for
  when the field requirements aren’t met, prompting a user to adjust what they
  had originally input. Keep help text short and informative and guide the user
  to the source of information when possible.
</Guideline>

## Behaviors

<Guideline title="Text overflow" image="input-behaviors-text-overflow.svg">
  When the field label is too long for the available horizontal space, it wraps
  to form another line. The field text itself truncates.

## Usage guidelines

<Guideline title="Include a label" image="input-usage-guidelines-1-do.svg" good>
  Every input should have a label. A field without a label is ambiguous and not
  accessible.

<Guideline
  title="Follow capitalization rules"

  Field labels and placeholder text should be in sentence case.

<Guideline
  title="Mark the minority of inputs in a form as required or optional"
  image="input-usage-guidelines-3-do.svg"
  good
>
  In a single form, mark only the required fields or only the optional fields,
  depending on whichever is less frequent in the entire form. If most of the
  inputs are optional, only the required fields should be give an asterisk or
  have labels appended with “(required)”. If most of the inputs are required,
  only the optional fields should be appended with “(optional)”. An asterisk
  should never be used to note that an input is optional.
</Guideline>
<Guideline image="input-usage-guidelines-3-dont.svg" bad></Guideline>

<Guideline title="Use help text to show hints, formatting, and requirements">
The description in the help text is flexible and encompasses a range of guidance. Sometimes this guidance is about **what** to input, and sometime it’s about **how** to input. This includes information such as:

- An overall description of the input field
- Hints for what kind of information needs to be input
- Specific formatting examples or requirements

The help text’s message should not simply restate the same information in the
label in order to prompt someone to interact with it. Don’t add help text if it
isn’t actually relevant or meaningful to a user in order to try to maintain
layout continuity with other inputs that require help text.

</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Use help text instead of placeholder text">
Putting instructions for how to complete an input, requirements, or any other essential information into placeholder text is not accessible, and should be avoided if possible. Once a value is entered, placeholder text is no longer viewable; if someone is using an automatic form filler, they will never get the information in the placeholder text.

Instead of placeholder text, use the help text description to convey
requirements or to show any formatting examples that would help user
comprehension. If there's placeholder text and help text at the same time, it
becomes redundant and distracting, and especially if they're communicating the
same thing.

</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Switch help text with error text">
The help text area also displays an error message. When a input already includes help text and an error is triggered, the help text is replaced with error text. Once the error is resolved, the help text description reappears below the field.

Since one gets replaced by the other, the language of the help text and error
text need to work together to convey the same messaging. Help text explains the
requirement or adds supplementary context for how to successfully complete the
input. Error text tells a user how to fix the error by re-stating the input
requirements or describing the necessary interaction. Make sure that the help
text and the error text include the same essential information so that it isn’t
lost if one replaces the other (e.g., password requirements).

</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Write error text that shows a solution">
Write error messaging in a human-centered way by guiding a user and showing them a solution — don’t simply state what’s wrong and then leave them guessing as to how to resolve it. Ambiguous error messages can be frustrating and even shame-inducing for users. Also, keep in mind that something that a system may deem an error may not actually be perceived as an error to a user.

Error text should be written in 1-2 short, complete sentences and in a clear and
straightforward way. End sentences with a period, and never with an exclamation
point. For inputs, the nature of the error is often related to something that
needs to be fixed for in-line validation, so a helpful tone is most appropriate.
For example, if someone were to miss filling out a required field that asks for
their email address, write the error text like you’re offering a hint or a tip
to help guide them to understand what needs to go in the missing field: “Enter
your email address.”
