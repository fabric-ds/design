Although most modern screen readers have OCR capabilities (Optical Character Recognition), they rely on the DOM (Document Object Model) / Accessibility Tree of a web page to provide information about its structure as well as its content. UX for users of screen readers is therefore mostly determined by the quality of the markup.
