# Setup Fabric React components

If you use React in your app, you can use the Fabric React components to get out
of the box functionality with baked in best practices. With Eik in place,
getting setup to use Fabric React components is straight forward.

## Setting it up

First, install the Fabric React package from NPM

```sh
npm install @fabric-ds/react
```

Next import the Fabric React package in your app. You specify which component(s)
you need to use as part of the import. Refer to the Fabric React docs to learn
more about the various components and how to use them.

```js
import { Button } from '@fabric-ds/react';
```

Components can then be used like any other React components in your code

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => console.log('clicked!')}>Call to Action</Button>
```
