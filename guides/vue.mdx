# Setup Fabric Vue components

If you use Vue in your app, you can use the Fabric Vue components to get out of
the box functionality with baked in best practices. With Eik in place, getting
setup to use Fabric Vue components is straight forward.

## Setting it up

First, install the Fabric Vue package from NPM

```sh
npm install @fabric-ds/vue
```

Next import the Fabric Vue package in your app. You specify which component(s)
you need to use as part of the import. Refer to the Fabric Vue docs to learn
more about the various components and how to use them.

```js
import { fButton } from '@fabric-ds/vue';
```

Components can then be used like any other Vue components in your code

```js
<f-button v-on:click="count++">You clicked me {{ count }} times.</f-button>
```
