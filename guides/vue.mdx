### Install and use Fabric Vue components

Fabric Vue components can be used to get out of the box functionality with baked
in best practices. With Eik in place, getting setup is pretty straight forward.

#### Install @fabric-ds/vue

First, install the Fabric Vue package from NPM

```sh
npm install @fabric-ds/vue
```

#### Import your first component

Next import the Fabric Vue package in your app. All our components are provided
from a single package and you can simply specify which component(s) you want to
use as part of an import statement.

Refer to the Fabric Vue docs to learn more about the various components and how
to use them.

In the following example, we import the button component

```js
import { Button } from '@fabric-ds/vue';
```

#### Using components

Once imported, components can then be used like any other Vue component in your
code. Refer to the docs for component usage.

```jsx
<f-button v-on:click="count++">You clicked me {{ count }} times.</f-button>
```
