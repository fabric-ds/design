### Install and use Fabric React components

Fabric React components can be used to get out of the box functionality with baked in best practices. With Eik in place,
getting setup is pretty straight forward.

#### Install @fabric-ds/react

First, install the Fabric React package from NPM

```sh
npm install @fabric-ds/react
```

#### Import your first component

Next import the Fabric React package in your app. All our components are provided from a single package and you can
simply specify which component(s) you want to use as part of an import statement.

Refer to the Fabric React docs to learn more about the various components and how to use them.

In the following example, we import the button component

```js
import { Button } from '@fabric-ds/react';
```

#### Using components

Once imported, components can then be used like any other React component in your code. Refer to the docs for component
usage.

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => console.log('clicked!')}>Call to Action</Button>
```
