### Add JavaScript support to Eik

Since we are going to be using Fabric JavaScript components, we need to extend our setup to support JavaScript files. To
do this we will need to create a scripts file to write our client side JavaScript code in and then bundle our source
code for production. In the example below we use Esbuild but you can also use Rollup or Webpack.

Firstly, create a `scripts.js` file for your JavaScript code

```sh:scripts.js
touch client/scripts.js
```

Next, install build dependencies for Esbuild.

```sh
npm install -D esbuild @eik/esbuild-plugin
```

With Esbuild dependencies installed, we now need to create a build script that produces a production ready JavaScript
bundle from your source code. We will name this `esbuild.js` but you can call it whatever you like.

Inside `esbuild.js` paste in the following configuration code:

```js:esbuild.js
// esbuild.js
import * as eik from '@eik/esbuild-plugin';
import esbuild from 'esbuild';

await eik.load();

await esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ['./client/scripts.js'],
  bundle: true,
  minify: true,
  format: 'esm',
  outfile: 'dist/scripts.js',
  target: ['es2017'],
  plugins: [eik.plugin()],
});
```

You should now be able to produce a build by running the build file with Node.js like so:

```sh
node esbuild.js
```
