### Install and use Fabric elements components

If you use don't use React or Vue in your app, you can still get the benefits of Fabric components and get out of the
box functionality with baked in best practices via custom elements. With Eik in place, getting setup to use custom
elements is straight forward.

#### Install @fabric-ds/elements

First, install the Fabric elements package from NPM

```sh
npm install @fabric-ds/elements
```

#### Import your first custom element

Next import the Fabric Elements package into your app. You do not need specify which elements(s) you need to use as part
of the import. Refer to the Fabric Elements docs to learn more about the various elements and how to use them.

**Please note:** For the time being, the elements package contains only a limited set of components with more to come in
the near future.

```js
import from '@fabric-ds/elements';
```

#### Using custom elements

Once the package has been imported, all custom elements will then be available to use in your HTML. Refer to the docs
for element usage.

```jsx
<f-breadcrumbs>
  <a href="#/url/1">Eiendom</a>
  <a href="#/url/2">Bolig til salgs</a>
  <a href="#/url/3" aria-current="page">
    {' '}
    Oslo{' '}
  </a>
</f-breadcrumbs>
```
