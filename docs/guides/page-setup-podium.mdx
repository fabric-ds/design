### Usage in a document

In a Podium podlet or layout,
your content will automatically be wrapped in an HTML document such that you can simply 
implement the content that should be placed within the HTML document's `<body>` tag.

```html
<html>
<head>
    ...
</head>
<body>
    You only need to implement the content here.
</body>
</html>
```

For this to work, you need to ensure that you are using the `podiumSend` method when rendering your content.

```js
(req, res) => res.podiumSend(`You only need to implement the content here.`);
```
