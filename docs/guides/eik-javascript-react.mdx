To complete the JavaScript setup, we need to add an appropriate import map. We use different import map files depending
on the libraries our apps use. For React, add the React Eik import map file to your `eik.json` file alongside the Fabric
import map we added earlier.

```json:eik.json
{
    ...
    "import-map": [
        "https://assets.finn.no/map/fabric/v1",
        "https://assets.finn.no/map/react/v1"
    ]
}
```

With that, you should be ready to start using Fabric React components in your app.
