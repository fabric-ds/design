# Search

A search field is used to quickly find the content you are looking for. Providing the user with suggestions based on recent searches and autocomplete will improve their user experience.

A search field does not need a label, but should contain a text hint/placeholder text and a search-icon at the right end of the input field.

## Auto complete text fields

These text fields are often used in search fields to present suggestions in real time or auto completion of words in a dropdown. This is for users to enter information/search more accurately and efficiently. It is especially useful for those with writing difficulties, when using a language you are not 100% comfortable with or you are unsure of the spelling.

## Best practice

### Do

- Use placeholder text to describe what the user can search for, for example "Search for car or cats" or "Search in your ads"
- Use auto complete suggestions to help the user to search faster
- Separate different categories in the auto complete suggestions

### Don't

- Do not show too many auto complete results, it will seem overwhelming to the user
- Do not let the search field be empty (before the user has typed anything)
- Do not use long or vague placeholder texts, the placeholder text is supposed to make it easier for the user
