## Options

### Label

Badges should always have a label for accessibility and clear comprehension.

### Variants

Badges come in 6 colors to represent different types of information. Use these variants to communicate the following statuses:

- Default
- Success
- Warning
- Error
- Sponsored
- Disabled

### Types of information

We have three types of information:

**Status of an ad**

- "Aktiv", "Inaktiv", "Solgt", "Slettet"...
- These should use the status ribbon component, while the two types below can be shown in another way.

**Mark advertisements/paid placemet**

- "Ukens bolig", "Annonse"

**FINN informs**

- "Visning i dag", "kommer for salg"

### Disabled

A badge in a disabled state shows that it exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that a badge may become available later. Badges should only be able to be disabled if they are interactive.

## Usage guidelines

### Do

Do use status ribbons in a users list of their ads, since that list will be a mix of ads with many different statuses.

### Don't

- Do not use a status ribbon to show that an ad is active on a results page. The majority of these ads are active so only show status on ads that are not active.
