# Modal

Modals (or dialogs) display important information that users need to acknowledge. They are overlays that prevent users
from interacting with the rest of the application until a specific action is taken. They can be disruptive because they
require merchants to take an action before they can continue interacting with the rest of the site. It should be used
thoughtfully and sparingly.

## Options

<Guideline title="Title" image="modal-options-title.svg">
  All modals must have a title. Titles appear in bold at the top of the dialog and use a few words to convey the outcome
  of what will happen if a user continues with an action.
</Guideline>

## Behaviors

<Guideline title="Behaviors" image="modal-behaviors.svg">
Modals should:

- Require that the user take an action.
- Close when the user presses the `X` button, the `Cancel` button, the `Esc` key, or when they complete the main action.
- Make all content behind the overlay become inactive.
 
</Guideline>

## Usage guidelines

<Guideline title="Keep it simple" goodImage="modal-usage-guidelines-1-do.svg">
  Use modals when merchants must complete an action before they can continue with the main workflow. Avoid using modals to
display complex forms or large amounts of information.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Two buttons only" goodImage="modal-usage-guidelines-2-do.svg"
badImage="modal-usage-guidelines-2-dont.svg">
Don't use more than two buttons (primary and secondary) at the bottom. This prevents unclear action hierarchy and
crowding on mobile screens. Since modals are for focused tasks, they should have focused actions. In some cases however,
a tertiary action may be appropriate.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Button layout" goodImage="modal-usage-guidelines-3-do.svg">
The cancel action should always be to the left, while the main action is to the right. Buttons are placed at the bottom
of the box.
</Guideline>
