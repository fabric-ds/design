# Radio

Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a list of mutually
exclusive options. All possible options are exposed up front for users to
compare.

## Anatomy

<Imagefullwidth image="radio-button-anatomy.svg" title="Radio button anatomy example" />

- Place radio buttons below each other to ensure that they are easier to find,
  read and work responsively.
- Separate radio buttons and checkboxes with labels.
- Consider dropdowns for more than 6 options.


## Options

<Guideline title="Label" image="radio-button-options-label.svg">
  Radio buttons should always have labels. When the label is not defined, a
  radio button becomes standalone. Standalone radio buttons are only used when
  their connection to other components is clear and they give sufficient context
  — for example, in a form to rate between 1 to 10 for several categories.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Disabled" image="radio-button-options-disabled.svg">
  A radio button in a disabled state shows that a selection exists, but is not
  available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity
  and communicate that an action may become available later.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Read-only" image="radio-button-options-read-only.svg">
  Radio buttons have a read-only option for when they’re in the disabled state
  but still need their labels to be shown. This allows for content to be copied,
  but not interacted with or changed.
</Guideline>

## Behaviors

<Guideline
  title="Keyboard focus"
  image="radio-button-behaviors-keyboard-focus.svg"
>
  A radio button can be navigated using a keyboard. The keyboard focus state
  takes the radio button’s visual hover state and adds a blue ring to the radio
  button in focus.
</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Text overflow"
  image="radio-button-behaviors-text-overflow.svg"
>
  When the label is too long for the horizontal space available, it wraps to
  form another line.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Mixed value" image="radio-button-behaviors-mixed-value.svg">
  When a radio button group presents multiple values that are not identical, the
  group should not show a selection. Any subsequent selection should update all
  values.
</Guideline>

## Usage guidelines

<Guideline
  title="Use radio buttons for mutually exclusive options" goodImage="radio-button-usage-guidelines-1-do.svg"
  badImage="radio-button-usage-guidelines-1-dont.svg">
  Radio buttons and checkboxes are not interchangeable. Radio buttons are best
  used for selecting a single option from a list of mutually exclusive options.
  Checkboxes are best used for selecting as many options as desired (or none).
</Guideline>

<Guideline
  title="Label groups of radio buttons" goodImage="radio-button-usage-guidelines-2-do.svg"
  badImage="radio-button-usage-guidelines-2-dont.svg">
  Groups of radio buttons should always have a label that clearly describes what
  the list of options represents. This is important for accessibility, since a
  screen reader will read the label before each option. Make sure to include a
  label, and don't assume that the options are self-explanatory without one.
  Write the label in sentence case. Place radio buttons in a vertical list to
  ensure they are easier to find, read, and work responsively.
