## Lets make a FINN page
So lets pretend we get a task to create a FINN page, we will use the [Min FINN](https://www.finn.no/min-finn) page as an example.

We will dig a little deeper into the main menu part of it.

The mobile version:

### 1. Getting setup
If not already done, there is a compehensive [setup-guide](https://www.fabric-ds.io/guide-setup) to get up and running. 

### 2. Header/Footer

### 3. Page-container
The purpose of this is to keep the page align correctly across the site, making it scale correctly on different window sizes/devices, and also keep it nice and tidy inside the outer banners. 

The sketch shows a background going full width outside the page-container, so we need to wrap it inside something that holds the background-color.

```html
	<div class="bg-blue-100">
		<div class="page-container"> ... </div>
	</div>
```

### 4. Grid
Thinking mobile first we just need standard `div` (display:block) behavior to get the 1 col layout we need on smaller devices.

```html
	<div> ... </div>
```

We add a grid to help us with the layout. The grid can start at the medium (md:) breakpoint and up from there giving us multiple columns only when we need them.

```html
	<div class="md:grid"> ... </div>
```

Adding 2 columns from medium breakpoint, and 3 columns from large and up.

```html
<div class="md:grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols3"> ... </div>
```

### 5. Adding cards
React/Vue/Element cards? Maybe choose one and show how its done?

### 6. Card content
![Screenshot of minfinn, one item from the main menu](guide-img/min-finn-card.png)
Looking at the layout for each card we would need a little bit of markup to start with, something like:
```html
	<div>
		<div>
			<svg></svg>
			<a href="#">Title</a>
		</div>	
		<p>text-content</p>
	</div>
```
Starting with the title, this should prob be the main linked item for the card. 

Screen readers do not like it if we wrap a whole card of content like this inside, neither a button or an A tag, the screenreader would treat all the content as one very long sentence with no other structure. 

The card component uses a trick where the `A` element (its required to have either an `A` element or a `Button` element to make a card component clickable) interactive area is stretched to the size of the full clickable card, so this is perfect for this use-case: 

We vertically center the icon and the title with flex. 

```html
	<div>
		<div class="flex items-center">
			<svg></svg>
			<a href="#">Title</a>
		</div>	
		<p>text-content</p>
	</div>
```

Dependent on the final page markup structure we probably want to wrap this title in an appropriate H tag. The H tags should be used in a semantic way, forming a clear tree structure not skipping any levels. The sizes and look of them can be set using the `t1`-`t5` class.

```html
	<div>
	  <div class="flex items-center">
	    <svg></svg>
	    <h3>
	      <a href="#" class="ml-16">Title</a>
	    </h3>
	  </div>
	  <p class="pt-8">text-content</p>
	</div>
```

The text-content bit is supposed to be hidden on mobile, since the responsive setup in Fabric is mobile first, we need to hide it for smaller devices and then un-hide it for bigger ones. This is easy using classes `hidden` and `md:block`. 

One thing to consider is if this hidden content should be available for screen-readers, even when hidden visually.

```html
	<div>
		<div class="flex items-center">
      		<svg></svg>
      		<h3>
        		<a href="#" class="ml-16">Min konto</a>
      		</h3>
    	</div>
    	<p class="pt-8 mr-8 hidden md:block">Se dine opplysninger på FINN og Schibstedkonto</p>
	</div>
```

The friendly UX person is now annoyed because we forgot the arrow to the right on the card, but that is no problem, we just wrap around another flex container.

```html
	<div class="flex items-center">
	  <div>
	    <div class="flex items-center">
	      <svg></svg>
	      <h3>
	        <a href="#" class="ml-16">Min konto</a>
	      </h3>
	    </div>
	    <p class="pt-8 mr-8 hidden md:block">Se dine opplysninger på FINN og Schibstedkonto</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="ml-auto">
	    <svg></svg>
	  </div>
	</div>
```

### 7. Serving SVG's
Fabric comes with its own [Icon library](https://github.com/fabric-ds/icons)
