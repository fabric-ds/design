## Options

<Guideline title="Label">
Switches should always have labels. When the label is not defined, a switch becomes standalone. Standalone switches should only be used when their connection to other components is clear and they give sufficient context — for example, in application panels.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Selection">
Switches can either be selected or not selected. They cannot be in an indeterminate state (unlike checkboxes). When a switch represents multiple values that are not identical, the switch should appear as not selected.

<Guideline title="Disabled">
A switch in a disabled state shows that a selection exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that an action may become available later.
           

## Behaviors

<Guideline title="Keyboard focus" image="switch-behaviors-keyboard-focus.svg">
A switch can be navigated using a keyboard. The keyboard focus state takes the switch’s visual hover state and adds a blue ring to the switch in focus.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Text overflow" image="switch-behaviors-text-overflow.svg">
When the label is too long for the horizontal space available, it wraps to form another line.
</Guideline>


## Usage guidelines

<Guideline title="When to use a standalone switch?">
Standalone switches should be used in situations where the context is clear without an associated text label. For example, a switch located at the top of a panel next to the panel's title makes it clear that the switch will enable/disable the panel options.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Switch or checkbox">
Switches are best used for communicating activation (e.g., on/off states), while checkboxes are best used for communicating selection (e.g., multiple table rows). Switches, unlike checkboxes, can't have an error state.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Representing mixed values">
When a switch represents multiple values that are not identical, the switch should appear as not selected. Any subsequent click or tap should select the switch, and update all values to be selected. Another click or tap after that should deselect the switch, and update all values to be not selected.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="No partial state">
Switches can only be on or off. When a parent switch represents a group of switches, it should be turned off unless all of the switches are on (turning the parent switch on turns all of the switches on). To show a partial state, use checkboxes instead.
</Guideline>
  
## Content standards

A label for a switch describes a setting that is either on or off — two mutually exclusive states. Use a short description (1-3 words) of the setting. Try to include all necessary information in the label, but it’s OK to add clarifying text after to supplement if needed.

Keep in mind that when a user takes an action on a switch, that action will often affect other content in an experience. Think systematically to ensure that all labels are paralleling each other in their writing.
  
<Guideline title="Consider if the label should use a verb or a noun">
A switch shows a state of persistence for something — a noun or a proper noun — as either being “on” or “off.” A verb isn’t usually needed to communicate the thing being turned on or off, but there can be instances where phrasing the label as a verb can aid in clarity. Just try to keep switches consistently using either verbs or nouns if you have more than one of them in a single view.
</Guideline>
  
<Guideline title="Avoid using verb phrases related to a state of activity">
Avoid using verb phrases related to activity states in a switch label, such as “turn on” or “turn off.” A switch is naturally either in a state of being on or off — active or inactive — so repeating in the label that something is “on” or “off” is redundant and clutters an interface.
</Guideline>
  
<Guideline title="Use neutral tone">
Because switches are used for controls and utility, their labels are written in a neutral, utilitarian way. There’s no need for overly celebratory language.
</Guideline>
  
<Guideline title="Use “you” or “your” if needed to refer to the user directly">
Describe switches objectively by using only the names of features or settings, or what those features and settings will do. In the case where it’s necessary to refer to a user directly, do so sparingly and use the second person “you/your.” We aim to be conversational and talk to the user — not as them.
</Guideline>
  
<Guideline title="Use sentence case">
Labels for switches are written in sentence case unless they contain words that are branded terms.
