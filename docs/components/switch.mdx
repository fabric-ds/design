# Switch

Switches allow users to turn an individual option on or off. They are usually used to activate or deactivate a specific
setting.

## Options

<Guideline title="Label" image="switch-options-label.svg">
  Switches should always have labels. When the label is not defined, a switch becomes standalone. Standalone switches
  should only be used when their connection to other components is clear and they give sufficient context — for example,
  in application panels.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Selection" image="switch-options-selection.svg">
  Switches can either be selected or not selected. They cannot be in an indeterminate state (unlike checkboxes). When a
  switch represents multiple values that are not identical, the switch should appear as not selected.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Disabled" image="switch-options-disabled.svg">
  A switch in a disabled state shows that a selection exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be
  used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that an action may become available later.
</Guideline>

## Behaviors

<Guideline title="Keyboard focus" image="switch-behaviors-keyboard-focus.svg">
  A switch can be navigated using a keyboard. The keyboard focus state takes the switch’s visual hover state and adds a
  blue ring to the switch in focus.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Text overflow" image="switch-behaviors-text-overflow.svg">
  When the label is too long for the horizontal space available, it wraps to form another line.
</Guideline>

## Usage guidelines

  Switches are best used for communicating activation (e.g., on/off states), while checkboxes are best used for
  communicating selection (e.g., multiple table rows). Switches, unlike checkboxes, can't have an error state.
