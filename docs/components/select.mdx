# Select

Selects (sometimes known as "dropdowns" or "pickers") allow users to choose from a list of options in a limited space.
The list of options can change based on the context.

## Options

<Guideline title="Label" image="select-options-label.svg">
  Selects should always have a label. The only exception to this rule is when a select is used in a row of filters. In
  this case the label becomes the text inside the select.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Label-position" image="select-options-label-position.svg">
  Labels should be placed on top of the select. This gives room for long copy, and responsive layouts.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Placeholder" image="select-options-placeholder.svg">
  The placeholder text, also commonly known as “ghost text,” prompts a user to select an option from the select menu. It
  disappears once a user selects an option.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Value" image="select-options-value.svg">
  The value shows the option that a user has selected.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Width" image="select-options-width.svg">
  The width of a select can be customized appropriately for its context.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Optional" image="select-options-optional.svg">
  Selects can be marked as optional. This is denoted with text added to the end of the label — “(optional)”.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Error" image="select-options-error.svg">
  A select can be marked as having an error to show that a value needs to be entered in order to move forward or that a
  value that was entered is invalid.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Disabled" image="select-options-disabled.svg">
  A select in a disabled state shows that an input field exists, but is not available in that circumstance. This can be
  used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that it may become available later. Where possible, we try to avoid
  using disabled states altogether.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Read-only" image="select-options-read-only.svg">
  Selects have a read-only option for when content in the disabled state still needs to be shown. This allows for
  content to be copied, but not interacted with or changed.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Help text" image="select-options-help-text.svg">
  A select can have help text below the field to give extra context or instruction about what a user should select. The
  help text area has two options: a description and an error message. The description communicates a hint or helpful
  information, such as specific requirements for what to choose. The error message communicates an error for when the
  selection requirements aren’t met, prompting a user to adjust what they had originally selected.
</Guideline>

## Behaviors

<Guideline title="Minimum width" image="select-behaviors-minimum-width.svg">
  The minimum width for a select is 2× the height of the field button. This guarantees that small pickers are readable
  and easy to target on touch devices.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Text overflow" image="select-behaviors-text-overflow.svg">
  When the field label and menu text are too long for the available horizontal space, they wrap to form another line.
  The field text itself truncates at the end, but the text can be shown in full in the menu.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Help text overflow" image="select-behaviors-help-text-overflow.svg">
  When the help text is too long for the available horizontal space, it wraps to form another line.
</Guideline>

<Guideline title="Menu height" image="select-behaviors-menu-height.svg">
  The picker menu can be as tall as necessary to show as many options as possible in the available space. There is no
  maximum height.
</Guideline>

## Usage guidelines

<Guideline title="Include a label" image="select-usage-guidelines-1-do.svg" good>
  Every picker should have a label. A picker without a label is ambiguous and not accessible.
</Guideline>
<Guideline image="select-usage-guidelines-1-dont.svg" bad></Guideline>

<Guideline title="Keep menu items concise" image="select-usage-guidelines-2-do.svg" good>
  Keep menu items short and concise. Long menu items that cause text to wrap to multiple lines are discouraged. If text
  wrapping becomes a frequent concern, consider revising the text or use alternative UI patterns that will give your
  content more space.
</Guideline>
<Guideline image="select-usage-guidelines-2-dont.svg" bad></Guideline>

<Guideline title="Choose an appropriate width" image="select-usage-guidelines-3-do.svg" good>
  When possible, the field button width should be wide enough so that any chosen menu items can be displayed in full.
</Guideline>
<Guideline image="select-usage-guidelines-3-dont.svg" bad></Guideline>

<Guideline title="Follow capitalization rules" image="select-usage-guidelines-4-do.svg" good>
  Field labels, placeholder text, and menu items should be in sentence case.
</Guideline>
<Guideline image="select-usage-guidelines-4-dont.svg" bad></Guideline>

<Guideline title="Mark fields that are not required as optional" image="select-usage-guidelines-5-do.svg" good>
  In a form, mark the fields that are not required as "optional". This lets the user know that they can choose whether
  to answer the questions or not, leaving it up to them how much extra information they want to share above the required
  information that is needed to complete the task.
</Guideline>
<Guideline image="select-usage-guidelines-5-dont.svg" bad></Guideline>

<Guideline title="Use help text to show context" image="select-usage-guidelines-6-do.svg" good>
  A select’s description in the helps to communicate what to select or how to select an option. This includes information such as:

- An overall description of the select options
- Hints for what kind of information to choose
- More context for why a user needs to make a selection

The help text should add extra context or description to the label. Don’t include help text unless it is actually
relevant or meaningful to a user.

</Guideline>
<Guideline image="select-usage-guidelines-6-dont.svg" bad></Guideline>

<Guideline title="Switch help text with error text" image="select-usage-guidelines-7-do.svg" good>
  The help text area also displays an error message. When a select already includes help text and an error is triggered, the help text is replaced with error text. Once the error is resolved, the help text description reappears below the select.

Since one gets replaced by the other, the language of the help text and error text need to work together to convey the
same messaging. Help text explains the requirement or adds supplementary context for how to complete the interaction.
Error text tells a user how to fix the error by re-stating the selection requirements or describing the necessary
interaction. Make sure that the help text and the error text include the same essential information so that it isn’t
lost if one replaces the other (e.g., minimum requirements).

</Guideline>
<Guideline image="select-usage-guidelines-7-dont.svg" bad></Guideline>

<Guideline title="Write error text that shows a solution" image="select-usage-guidelines-8-do.svg" good>
  Write error messaging in a human-centered way that guide a user and show them a solution. Ambiguous error messages can be frustrating and even shame-inducing for users. Also, keep in mind that something that a system may deem an error may not actually be perceived as an error to a user.

Error text should be written in 1-2 short, complete sentences and in a clear and straightforward way. End sentences with
a period, and never with an exclamation point. For selects, the nature of the error is often related to something that
needs to be fixed for in-line validation, so a helpful tone is most appropriate. For example, if someone were to miss
selecting an option to note as their preferred contact method, write the error text like you’re offering a hint or a tip
to help guide them to understand what needs to be selected: “Select a contact method.”
